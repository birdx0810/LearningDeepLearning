# Learning Deep Learning
This repository holds some code implementation of highly used functions used in deep learning that are implemented using NumPy. This repository also some code for using TensorFlow (v1), Keras (TF2.0), and PyTorch for Deep Learning in text, audio, and image. The author hopes that these simple code could be of a good help to the deep learning community.

Models implemented include:
- Intro (NumPy)
    - [ ] Activation functions
    - [ ] Loss functions
    - [ ] Similarity/distance functions
- Basic (TF, Keras, PyTorch)
    - [ ] MLP for tabular data classification (Titanic)
    - [ ] RNN for text classification (Yelp Polarity)
    - [ ] RNN for audio classification (YesNo)
    - [ ] CNN for time series classification (ECG5000)
    - [ ] CNN for image classification (CIFAR10)
- Advanced (PyTorch Only)
    - [ ] AttSeq2Seq for neural dialog generation
    - [ ] MIDI-VAE for music style transfer
    - [ ] DCGAN for synthetic image generation
