# Learning Deep Learning
This repository holds some code implementation of highly used functions used in deep learning that are implemented using NumPy. This repository also some code for using TensorFlow (v1), Keras (TF2.0), and PyTorch for Deep Learning in text, audio, and image. The author hopes that these simple code could be of a good help to the deep learning community.

Models implemented include:
- MLP for text classification (Yelp Polarity)
- AutoEncoder for sequential data (YesNo)
- DCGAN for image generation (MNIST)
